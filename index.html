    <P style="line-height: 1.5;">During my first week at AkiraChix, I was really surprised by the diversity and new environment. I found my self taking many pictures aroudnd the campus.
        However, I also experienced a lot of confusion, particularly with the <b>language</b> and the <b>food</b>. My struggle with English was compounded by the different 
        accents I encountered, which were unlike what I had learned in high school. Additionaly, I was perplexed by the new foods that were served, many of which
        I had never seen before. Fortunately, just three days later, I grew to really like all the food.
    </p>
    <p>The following are some of the pictures which I took.</p>

    <p>When I experinced things at AkiraChix I divided them into two.</p>
    <h2>Good things and bad things </h2>
        <h3>Good things</h3>
        <!-- Those are the unordered lists. -->
        <ul>
            <li>Neatness</li>
            <li>Sisterhood</li> 
            <li>Diversity</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Not so far good things</h3>
        <!-- Those are ordered lists. -->
        <ol>
            <li>Fixed study time</li>
            <li>Meetings</li>
            <li>Noices at the class</li>
